Week 3 Boris Bikes Project - Testing using mocks and doubles
============================================================

Objective
---------
To continue building the system for Boris Bikes using mocks and doubles in the sepcs. Mocks stand in for more complex objects, allowing developers to write the tests without actually instantiating new instances of classes. Using mocks and doubles allows developers to focus the tests of the behaviour of the system uner the test without being concerned about the various dependencies.
